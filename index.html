            Software development is when a user desires to create new software
            or, usually, upgrade their already existing system for a more
            efficient one. The users can be as diverse and large as an entire
            corporation or organization, a team that relies heavily on said
            software or even a small group of individuals. Once they establish
            that they wish to create a new system or upgrade said existing
            system, they will be required to devise and implement a master plan
            which will lead to the creation of this new system. Several steps
            are required to complete this software development process. This
            includes, but is not limited to, working out what the system needs
            to accomplish, developing it accordingly, writing out the code,
            thorough testing and debugging, and finally launching, should
            everything work out. This development process can take as few as a
            motivated programmer to several or even hundreds of developers.

            For developing software several processes or methodologies are being
            selected for the development of the project depending on the
            projectâ€™s aims and goals. There are many development life cycle
            models that have been developed in order to achieve different
            required objectives. The models specify the various stages of the
            process and the order in which they are carried out.

          <h2 class="margin-bottom">What is a database?</h2>
          <h4 class="margin-bottom">September 26, 2022 by Stephan Mingoes</h4>

          <p>
            A database is a collection of data that is organized so that it can
            easily be accessed and used by an application. The data are stored
            in tables and are arranged in columns and rows, similar to a
            spreadsheet. A database management system (DBMS) keeps track of the
            organization of data in the database and allows users to access the
            data quickly through the use of queries.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A database system is made up of objects, such as fields, records,
            files, indexes and other things which interact together to form a
            database. These objects work together to store, manage and retrieve
            data.

            I am a Computer Science student at The University of The West
            Indies. I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and
            constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive
            towards.
